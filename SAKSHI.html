<p>Do you remember,<br>
those silent freezing nights,<br>
when we used to be under the blanket?<br>
You hugged me tightly <br>
and heard my poetries <br>
which i wrote on you.<br>
You kept on saying that <br>
how can you write so good!<br>
Even though i wrote terrible those days.<br>
I used to tell you that<br>
how i plucked roses and <br>
sat anywhere under the open sky<br>
and then i kept on counting,<br>
he loves me,<br>
he loves me not,<br>
he loves me,<br>
he loves me not, <br>
But that last petal always stated<br>
"He loves me not".<br>
But still, idk how somewhere i believed<br>
that you loved me, <br>
And you always smiled and <br>
kissed me on my neck by saying,<br>
"Yes, i do sweetheart"<br>
Ahhh! I miss those nights.<br>
You asked me once that<br>
why i never forced you to <br>
take me on a date, like any other girlfriend<br>
and i always said that <br>
why will i need any uncomfortable<br>
date, when i am getting <br>
this comfortable cuddling.<br>
We laughed so hard on every <br>
small thing!!!! Our stomach,<br>
often hurted because of that.<br>
Can you do that all over again?<br>
Please show me once more that how beautifully you loved me<br>
